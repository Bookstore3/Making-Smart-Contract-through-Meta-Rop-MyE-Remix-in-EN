# Chapter 3
### Using contract with MetaMask and Ropsten test network

In this chapter we are going to use accounts of the Meta Mask, instead of the accounts of Java Script VM, to distribute the smart contract and interact with it.

The fundamental method of distributing the smart contract is similar.

First, let's install the Meta Mask on chrome and make an account.
Remember to save the password and the 12 words which are made during the account making.

>We will use the Chrome browser in this article.
>If you get any https related warning, please reconnect to the Remix with http.

Now that we have our first account, let's click the rotating arrow icon on top right corner of the Meta Mask page.
>If you have installed the Meta Mask properly, you will see the fox icon on the top right corner of the Chrome. Click it and you will see the small Meta Mask page.

Click on it, and you will see the Create Account tab.
Click on the tab and make 2 more account.

Now that we have three accounts, let's rename those accounts as the Owner, the IoT device and the Client.

After that copy and paste the address of the each account. You can do this by clicking the three dots on the top right corner and click on the Copy the address on clipboard tab. After that write the address on the note.

We will need their address later.

After finishing renaming the accounts, click on the network tab on the left corner and choose Ropsten Test Net.
>**Note:** The Main Ethereum Network will use the actual Ether.

In order to test on the Ropsten network, we need a Ether for the test.
Click on the Buy button and request test Ether frome the Ropsten Testnet Faucet.
They will send 1 Ether at a time and this will take a few seconds.
>This is not a real Ether. You can't take this Ether to the Main network.

Do the same process on the other accounts and get at least two Ethers each.

Now we have finished all the set up for distributing the contract on the Ropsten network.

Let's distribute the contract from the Remix like we did on the Chapter 2.

First, choose the Owner account from the Meta Mask.
Then go to the Remix and choose the Run time environment as a Injected Web3.

You will see in the Account tab that the same address has appeared as the one we chose on the Meta Mask, the address of the Owner account.

We need the address of the Iot device in order to deploy the contract.
Copy the address of the IoT device from the note.
If you didn't copied and pasted the address on the note, you can see the address from the Meta Mask page by changing the account into the IoT device.
>**Note:** Make sure to change the account back to the Owner account after copying the address of the IoT device. We need to deploy the contract as an Owner not as an IoT device.

Paste the address of the IoT device next to the deploy button and press the button.
Then the Meta Mask page will show up and it will ask for your confirmation.
**Set the gas price to 1 or any number you'd like** and press submit button to finish deploying the contract.
>If you get an error to unlock the accounts, refresh the page by pressing the F5 and try again. After you refreshed the page, please check the address of the accounts again.

If the contract was successfully deployed, there would be a log saying that the contract is being deployed on the Ropsten network.
Click on the link to check the status of our contract. The page will indicate that the status of the contract is pending, meaning that the contract is waiting to be recorded in the Ropsten test network blockchain.
When the pending is over, it will show the block number that our contract has been included.

If you'd like to search the block and check our contract, you should type the number of the block on the Ropsten test network.

Now that our contract has successfully recorded in the blockchain, let's use the contract as a client.


In order to interact with the smart contract we need to know two information.
1. The address of the smart contract.
2. ABI of the smart contract.

The address will be the address of our smart contract.
Also, we need to know that this address is the address of the smart contract (CA) and is different from the account address that people or the subject use (EOA).

The ABI of the smart contract is an interface of the smart contract.
For example, if you want to send an Ether using payToController it would look like below.

~~~
var sc = eth.contract (ABI code of the smart contract)
~~~

First we put the ABI of the contract into the variable sc, then we use below code to use the ABI.

~~~
sc.payToController.sendTransaction(from:eth.accounts[2], gas:3000000, value: web3.toWei(1, "ether"))
//By using ABI (sc), we use payToController (function) to send a Ether (sendTransaction) from the client account (eth.accounts[2])
~~~

We can send a Ether with a command like above to the smart contract by using the function, payToController.

This is not a user friendly way to interact with the contract. This is the reason why the Remix provided us with the simple user interface on the browser.
This time, we will use the similar interface on the Ropsten network to interact with our contract.

First, copy the address of the deployed contract and paste it on the note.
Then, go to the Compile tab and press Details button.

You will see all kinds of information about the deployed contract which has been compiled.
If you look down below, you will find the ABI information part.

Click on the clipboard icon and **copy the whole ABI.** Then, paste the ABI on the note.

Now, we will have the address and the ABI of the contract on the note.

Next, open another browser and **change the Meta Mask account to the Client account.**

Let's go to the MyEtherWallet page.
Click on the Contracts tab of the page.

Then you will see tabs that we can put the address oand the ABI of the contract.
>Click on the Interact with Contract if you can't see the above tab.

Copy and paste the address and the ABI of our contract into these tab.
Then press Access button.

Now you will be able to locate the Select a funtion tab below.
This tab will hold the same UI that we've seen from the Remix.

Select the payToController tab and choose the Meta Mask for the wallet.
Then click on the Connect to Meta Mask button.

Now we can use the contract using the accounts of the Meta Mask.

To summarize what we've done so far, we have deployed the contract from the Remix as a Owner account. Then as a Client, we've went to the MyEtherWallet and connected with the contract using the address and the ABI of the contract.

Now let's choose the Select a function tab and send a Ether to the contract using the payToController.

Choose payToController and click WRITE below.
You will see the page where we can send the amount of the Ether.

<img src ="https://github.com/Bookstore3/Making-Smart-Contract-through-Meta-Rop-MyE-Remix-in-EN/blob/master/images/R2M2_08.png">

Set the value to 1 since we are going to send 1 Ether.
After that, if we wait for a second, it will indicate the estimated gas limit.
Now let's make a transaction by clicking the Generate Transaction button.

You will see the information about the transaction and also the confirmation box.
Click on the Yes, I am sure! Make transaction button.

<img src ="https://github.com/Bookstore3/Making-Smart-Contract-through-Meta-Rop-MyE-Remix-in-EN/blob/master/images/R2M2_09.png">

Then it will show the Meta Mask page and this time, it will automatically estimate the gas price. Let's press the SUBMIT button.

Now the Client account has made a transaction to send a Ether to the contract.
You can check the status of the transaction by clicking the Meta Mask icon on the browser and check on the SENT list. If you click on the list, you will be able to find the transaction on the Etherscan Ropsten browser.

<img src ="https://github.com/Bookstore3/Making-Smart-Contract-through-Meta-Rop-MyE-Remix-in-EN/blob/master/images/R2M2_10.png">

If the status of our transaction is in pending, we need to wait until it gets recorded on the blockchain.
After the pending is over, our transaction will be successfully recorded on the Ropsten blockchain.

Now let's check if the status of the client has changed to true.

Select controllers from the Select a function tab. Then put 0 into the index number and click READ.
(Since we were the first client, our index number would be 0)

<img src ="https://github.com/Bookstore3/Making-Smart-Contract-through-Meta-Rop-MyE-Remix-in-EN/blob/master/images/R2M2_11.png">

If our transaction were successful, controllers will return the address of the client, endTime and the status. This time it will return the status as TRUE.

Now the client have successfully rented the IoT device.

Next, we will make the status of the client to false as a IoT device since their end Time would have passed.

>One thing to consider is that we have used keyword 'now' to set the standard of the end time. 'now' is the timeStamp of the block. The value of the 'now' will only increase if the blocks are consistently made. Ropsten test network makes the block consistently so after a few minutes or seconds, depending on the block mining rate of the Ropsten network, the endTime of the client will be passed.

Now let's change the account of the Meta Mask to the IoT device.
After that, let's refresh the page by pressing F5 button.

We will type the address and the ABI of the contract once more and Access it.
This time we have accessed the contract as the IoT device.

Select updateStatus function from the Select a function tab and put the value as 0 since we are going to change the status of the first client.
Choose Meta Mask and click on Connect to Meta Mask.

If the value we just put has disappeared, write the value again and click WRITE.
We don't need to send the Ether to the contract so leave the value as 0 and click on 'Generate Transaction' then 'Yes, I am sure! Make transaction'.
The Meta Mask page will pop again. Click on SUBMIT.

After waiting for our transaction to be recorded into the blockchain, let's check the status of the client by using controllers.

Choose 'Select a function' tab and put value 0 since we are going to check the first client's status.
Then you will see the status of the first client has changed into FASLE.
We have successfully ended the rent status of the client.

<img src ="https://github.com/Bookstore3/Making-Smart-Contract-through-Meta-Rop-MyE-Remix-in-EN/blob/master/images/R2M2_12.png">

Lastly, let's withdraw the Ether that has been sent to this contract as an Owner.

Select Owner account in the Meta Mask page and refresh the page.
Put the address and the ABI of the contract like before.

Let's select withdrawFunds from the Select a function tab and connect to the Meta Mask account. Then, click on the WRITE button.

Since we are not sending the Ether so leave the value as 0 and make a transaction.
Wait for our transaction to be recorded in the blockchain and check the account balance of the Owner.

You will see the balance of the Owner account has increased as a value of 1.

<img src ="https://github.com/Bookstore3/Making-Smart-Contract-through-Meta-Rop-MyE-Remix-in-EN/blob/master/images/R2M2_14.png">

This has been the interactions with our deployed contract.
We have used the Ropsten test network to do the same process we did on chapter 2.

---

This has been the making smart contract through Meta Mask, Ropsten test network, MyEtherWallet and Remix.
I hope this article has been helpful on understanding the usage of the smart contract.
